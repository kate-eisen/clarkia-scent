    all_data_standardized_mass.csv : scent data per individual plant. Emission rates are in micrograms scent per hour per g floral fresh mass. Emission rates have been adjusted so that all compounds were present in a minimum of 5x the concentration of the compound in the ambient control and vegetative control samples. Emission rates that did not pass this ratio test were entered as zeros.
    
    all_data_standardized_flowers.csv : scent data per individual plant. Emission rates are in micrograms scent per hour per flower. Emission rates have been adjusted so that all compounds were present in a minimum of 5x the concentration of the compound in the ambient control and vegetative control samples. Emission rates that did not pass this ratio test were entered as zeros.
    
    SPME_data_no_blanks.csv: long-form data from floral dissections and growth-response curves collected using Solid-Phase Micro Extractions (SPME). See appendix 1 for methodological details
    
    SPME_info.csv: species and community information for the SPME samples.
    
    concentrations.csv: wide-format data from wounding common garden. See appendix 2 for methodological details.
   
analysis_scripts

    Main_analyses_for_scent.R : Contains all main analyses performed in the manuscript. Two multivariate analyses: adonis and capscale. Then, provides code to identify which of the scent compounds are highly correlated with the capscale axes. Tests of variation across species and community types in total scent, the four compound classes, and the nine compounds that show patterns consistent with character displacement. Tests for the compounds that were correlated with the capscale axes but did not show a pattern consistent with character displacement are not included, but could be run using very lightly modified code.
    
    plots.R : Contains all code needed to reproduce Figures 1, 2, and 3 in the main text of the manuscript (visualizing the capscale analysis, and plotting the means +/- SEs for the compound classes and the nine compounds that showed patterns consistent with character displacement.
